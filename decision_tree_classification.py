#why we use decision tree clsssififctaion instead of logitic 
"""
logistic regression have linear boundries 
if a straight line cant divide the data in 2 equal parts then logistic fails
where DT have complex non linear bounddries

outliers se effect nhi hota
no  need to change categorical data into numerical 0 or 1
